### Project Description 

The following analysis seeks to identify various correlations between demographic and heart disease data. 

### Sketch of Final Product
The end result will involve a visual representation of the many different coorilations made from the data set. 


### Break Down of Data Set
* Age age in years 
* Sex Female or male
* Cp Chest pain type (typical angina, atypical angina, non-angina, or asymptomatic)
* Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
* Cholesterol Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
* Fasting blood sugar (< 120 mg/dl or > 120 mg/dl)
* Rest (ECG) Resting electrocardiography results (normal, ST-T wave abnormality, or left ventricular hypertrophy)
* Max Heart Rate Max. heart rate achieved during thalium stress test
* Exercise induced angina (yes or no)
* ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* Slope of peak exercise ST segment (upsloping, flat, or downsloping)
* Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
* NST Result Thalium stress test result (normal, fixed defect, or reversible defect)
* Target Heart disease status: number of major vessels with >50% narrowing (No Disease, Disease)

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks
age's compared to chest pain types
correlation between age and presence of heart disease
correlation between cholesterol and presence of heart disease
correlation between chest pain type and presence of resting EKG results

### Research Questions
What is the coorilation between heart disease and age?

What is the coorilation between cholesterol levels and heart disease?

What is the coorilation between chest pain type and the presense of the resting EKG results?
